# Bloggit

Bloggit is a blogging web application. This is my first big project and is still very much a work in progress, so please excuse the code quality.
Bloggit allows users to create a profile and write public and private blog posts with a rich-text editor, as well as comment, follow users,
and (eventually) share posts on social media. The goal is to clean up the code base a little more, add a feature for social media sharing and deploy as a demo.

## Built With:
* PHP
* [Slim 3 microframework](http://www.slimframework.com/)
* [Twig template engine](https://twig.symfony.com/)
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
